          Essentially, PUIs are any person who has been or is waiting
          to be tested. This includes: persons who are considered
          high-risk for COVID-19 due to recent travel, contact with a
          known case, exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 as determined by
          a healthcare professional, or some combination thereof.
          PUI’s also include people who meet laboratory testing
          criteria based on symptoms and exposure, as well as
          confirmed cases with positive test results. PUIs include any
          person who is or was being tested, including those with
          negative and pending results.
        </dd>

        <dt>Monitored</dt>
        <dd>
          People the Florida Department of Health was notified of for
          possible monitoring because they are a contact of a case,
          recently traveled to an area with community spread, or were
          identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
          (CDC) as a part of an airline/ship contact investigation.
          Not all persons who were initially reported are still
          monitored, depending on their circumstances, negative test
          results, or continued period of no symptoms.
        </dd>

        <dt>Hospitalization</dt>
        <dd>
          Count of all laboratory confirmed cases in which an
